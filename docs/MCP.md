# GoalAgents MCP protocol

GoalAgents is a dashboard of your goals as funnels, worked by your AI agents. Everything on it is written by the agents through this MCP server; the person looks, clicks for details, and answers an agent's question right on the dashboard when it asks. The server is `supabase/functions/mcp`, the tables are in `supabase/migrations`; the demo at `/demo` runs on made-up data in `src/data.js`, shaped the same way.

## Quick start

Paste this into your agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any other that supports MCP), or copy it from [goalagents.run/connect](https://goalagents.run/connect/):

```
Connect this MCP server for me: https://goalagents.run/mcp (GoalAgents, remote, sign-in with OAuth). If you can't connect it yourself, tell me exactly how to do it in this app.
```

The agent adds the server or tells you how; you sign in on goalagents.run and allow it. Then tell it which goal to work on.

## Connection

- Remote MCP server, Streamable HTTP: `https://goalagents.run/mcp`.
- Auth: OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration, the same flow as other remote connectors (Claude: Connectors → Add custom connector; Claude Code: `claude mcp add --transport http goalagents https://goalagents.run/mcp`; ChatGPT: Developer mode → Create, OAuth). Supabase Auth is the authorization server; the person signs in on goalagents.run and allows the agent on `/oauth/consent`. No keys to copy.
- Everything an agent sees is on goalagents.run: a Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare/worker.js`) serves the discovery documents and passes `/mcp` to the Supabase Edge Function and `/auth/*` to Supabase Auth.
- Every tool runs as that person: the server never uses a service key, and row-level security keeps each person's funnels their own.
- Plans (see `/pricing/`): **Free** — up to 3 funnels with up to 3 stages each and one agent per zone; **Pro**, $10 a month — up to 10 funnels with up to 5 stages each and two agents per zone (5 is what the dashboard draws). During early access everyone is on Pro for free. The database enforces the limits; `list_funnels` returns the plan.
- The person does two things only: connects the server and tells the agent which goal to work. Agents create funnels, connect sources, and report everything else. The server sends the rules below to the agent as MCP instructions.

## Model

**Funnel** — one goal, drawn as a vertical flask.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable id, chosen by the agent (`job-search`) |
| `title` | Column title (`Job Search`) |
| `result` | Name of one result: `[singular, plural]` (`offer, offers`); Russian uses three forms `[1, 2–4, 5+]`, Spanish two like English; Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese use one |
| `theme` | Look of the column: `mine` (miners, ore, treasure chests), `lab` (chemists, liquids, flasks), `garden` (gardeners, sprouts and flowers, flower pots), `love` (cupids, hearts), `code` (hackers, code, chips), `money` (bankers; pennies, banknotes, silver and gold bars, bitcoins; money bags). Default `mine` |
| `source_url` | Link to the table or list with the funnel's items (Google Sheet, Notion, Airtable…). One per funnel. Optional, but an agent gives it whenever its list opens by a URL; the dashboard then draws spreadsheet sheets in the hopper on top, and a click opens the link |
| `goal.total` | How many results the goal needs |
| `goal.every_days` | Pace: one result every N days |
| `stages` | 2–5 stages, top to bottom (free plan: 2–3) |
| `results` | How many results came out so far |

**Stage** — one tank.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key` | Stable key inside the funnel (`applied`) |
| `label` | `[singular, plural]` (`interview, interviews`), shown next to the count; Russian uses three forms, Spanish two; Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese one |
| `count` | How many items have ever reached this stage, cumulative: an item that moved on to the next stage still counts here. The conversion between stages comes from these counts |

Names (`title`, `result`, stage `label`) are shown as written, so give them in the person's language; the dashboard's own interface follows the language the person picked (English, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Thai or Vietnamese).

Only counts, dates and links are stored. Item lists (vacancies, people, papers) stay in the person's own sources.

**Zone** — the mining area around a tank where agents work. Zone `0` is the inflow above the first stage; zone `k` (1 ≤ k < n) moves items from stage `k-1` into stage `k`; zone `n`, below the last stage, is the output zone where agents turn last-stage items into results. A zone holds **at most two agents** on Pro (left and right of the pipe) and one on the free plan; the server rejects more.

**Agent presence** — what an agent is doing right now.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `agent` | `claude`, `chatgpt`, `grok`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `kimi`, `qwen`, `mistral`, `perplexity`, `hermes`; sets shirt colour and logo. Any other name gets a plain grey shirt |
| `funnel_id`, `zone` | Where the agent stands |
| `state` | `work` (mining), `sleep` (waiting for its next scheduled run), `ask` (waiting for the person) |
| `next_run_at` | For `sleep`: when it starts again; shown as a countdown. More than 5 minutes past it with no new state from the agent, the dashboard marks it as not woken up, so call `set_agent_state(work)` first thing in every run |
| `question` | For `ask`: what the agent needs from the person |
| `question_id` | For `ask`: the open question; the person answers it on the dashboard |
| `chat_url` | Link to the agent's chat or session |

## Tools

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `list_funnels()` | The plan and its limits; funnels, stages, counts, results, goal, agents present and open questions |
| `upsert_funnel(id, title, result, goal_total, goal_every_days, source_url?, theme?, stages[])` | Create or update a funnel and its stages (`key`, `label`); stages keep their counts by key |
| `report_counts(funnel_id, counts{stage_key: n}, results?, fill_percent?{stage_key: 0–100}, pace?{zone: x}, flow_per_day?{stage_key or "results": n}, source_url?)` | Counts after the agent's work, cumulative (everything that ever reached a stage); the server stores each report with a timestamp. `source_url` sets the funnel's list link (`null` removes it). Optional manual readings: tank fill in %, gauge pace (1 = just in time) and the flow written on a tank (`+N/d`) in items per day, by stage key or `results`; `null` returns one to automatic |
| `add_result(funnel_id)` | One more result came out (increments `results`) |
| `set_agent_state(funnel_id, agent, zone, state, next_run_at?, question?, chat_url?, added?)` | Presence of an agent; one presence per agent per funnel. With `ask` it returns a `question_id`. Coming to `work` from sleep starts a run: the dashboard shows by the agent how much the run added (the count it works into minus that count at the start), kept while it sleeps; `added` sets the number by hand. Each run is kept with its start, end (going to sleep or `clear_agent`), zone and what it added, for the agent's history on the dashboard. A new question emails the person if they turned emails on |
| `get_answer(question_id, wait_seconds?)` | The person's answer, or null; waits up to 50 s |
| `close_question(funnel_id, agent, question_id?, answer?)` | The person answered elsewhere (in the agent's chat): closes that question, or all the agent's open questions in the funnel, so the dashboard stops showing it as waiting |
| `clear_agent(funnel_id, agent)` | The agent leaves the funnel |
| `delete_funnel(funnel_id)` | Delete a funnel and everything in it, only when the person asks |

Write tools return the updated funnel so the agent can check what the person sees.

## What the server computes

Every reading below is **automatic** by default. An agent can set the tank fill and the gauges **by hand** instead (optional `fill_percent`, `pace` and `flow_per_day` in `report_counts`), for example when it knows the conversion better than the count history shows, or before there are two reports to compute from. A manual reading stays until the agent sends `null` for it.

Unless an agent set them by hand, flows, forecasts and gauge readings come from the count history (agents see current counts in `list_funnels`, not this history):

- **Flow** of a zone (`+14/d` on the tank it feeds): how much the count of that stage grew over the last 7 days, averaged per day (shown per week when slower). With less than a day of history the growth so far counts as one day's, so the first reports don't extrapolate (+1 in an hour is +1/d, not +24/d).
- **Gauge reading** of a zone: will the tank it feeds be full by the goal's date at this zone's current flow? The date is when the remaining results are due at the goal pace (one per `goal.every_days`). The reading is what the flow brings by then ÷ what the tank still misses, on a log scale; the red mark on the right is 1, just in time. So the needle and the tank's level always agree: a tank that is behind has its needle left of the mark. It is an estimate for the picture only.
- **Output zone**: its flow is results per day (from the `results` history), shown next to the results count under the funnel; its gauge compares that with the goal rate, and the `next` line under the results gives the estimated time to the next result, coloured by pace (red far behind, yellow close, green on pace, bright green well ahead).
- **Tank fill** (a heap of pieces rising from the bottom, a liquid in the lab): items at a stage so far ÷ items needed there for the whole goal (`goal.total` results). "Needed" comes from the conversion between the tanks' counts below it: the next stage's count ÷ this stage's (the results for the last stage). Where either is still 0, a default conversion of 30% stands in, so a tank shows a level from the first report.
- **No flow yet**: a flow with fewer than two reports in the last 7 days counts as 0, so the tank shows `+0/d` and the gauge rests at zero until reports come in (or the agent sets `flow_per_day`).

## What an agent should do on every run

1. `set_agent_state(state: "work")` in the zone it works on.
2. Do its job; after meaningful progress call `report_counts` (and `add_result` when a result appears).
3. If it needs the person — approval, a missing file, a decision — `set_agent_state(state: "ask", question)` and poll `get_answer(question_id)`; the person answers on the dashboard. While the agent is in `ask` it stands waiting and takes the answer at once. If it goes to sleep before the answer comes, the question stays in a bubble over the sleeping agent and the dashboard tells the person the answer will be picked up only on the agent's next run; the agent calls `get_answer` then. If the person answers in the agent's chat instead, the agent calls `close_question` so the `!` goes away.
4. At the end: `set_agent_state(state: "sleep", next_run_at)` until its next scheduled run, or `clear_agent` if it has no schedule.
